From Uncle Bob:  3 laws of TDD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9GQ9nBHhIc

1- not allowed to write production code unless it's to make a failing test pass
2- not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (not compiling is failing and you must stop once it fails)
3- not allowed to write any more prod code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

More than one expectation per test is a 'no-no'
